# Dump and Restore Elastic Indices

Sometimes could be helpful to dump the documents in an Elastic index on disk so that can be "cold" stored and eventually restored later. [ElasticDumper]() allows to dump on disk a set of zipped files containing an index (or a part of it) and if necessary allows to restore it later.
